# dotfiles
my dotfiles

Most of the time I'm switching between Windows and linux env.
So my dotfiles contains config to run on either Windows + cygwin (babun) and linux.

**TODO**
- [ ] easy install adding a makefile or a shell script
- [ ] moving [https://github.com/trotro/dockerized-apps] to a .dockerfunc
 - [ ] make it working for both linux and Windows
